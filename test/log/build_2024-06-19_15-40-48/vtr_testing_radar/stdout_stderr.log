[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findvtr_common.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "vtr_common", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "vtr_common" with
  any of the following names:

    vtr_commonConfig.cmake
    vtr_common-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "vtr_common" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "vtr_common_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "vtr_common" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
